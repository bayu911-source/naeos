# NAEOS Golden Path

The Golden Path is the repository's smallest reproducible proof of the NAEOS engineering control plane. It is designed for a first-time engineer, evaluator, or integration partner to run locally without an external service or AI API key.

## Objective

Prove this sequence end to end:

```text
Specification
    ↓
NEIR
    ↓
Validation
    ↓
Policy
    ↓
AI Context
    ↓
Authorized Generation
    ↓
Artifacts
    ↓
Traceable Evidence
```

The Golden Path is implemented by the checked-in CLI demo at [`examples/demo-cli/`](../examples/demo-cli/).

## Five-minute run

From a clean checkout:

```bash
go build -o naeos ./cmd/naeos
./examples/demo-cli/run-demo.sh
```

No LLM API key is required for the default path. AI compilation is an optional stage when `NAEOS_LLM_API_KEY` is configured.

To isolate output outside the repository:

```bash
NAEOS_DEMO_OUTPUT_DIR=/tmp/naeos-demo ./examples/demo-cli/run-demo.sh
```

## Acceptance criteria

A Golden Path run is successful only when all of these are true:

1. `spec.yaml` is accepted by the specification validator.
2. The CLI can inspect the derived NEIR.
3. A deliberately invalid policy configuration is rejected.
4. AI context is generated as both Markdown and JSON.
5. The normal generation pipeline completes.
6. `run.json` contains `run_id`, `specification_hash`, `neir_hash`, validation, policy, context, audit, and stage metadata.
7. Expected generated project files exist.
8. A summary is written under the isolated run directory.

### What you just proved

A successful run establishes this repository-backed control-plane sequence:

```text
Specification
  → NEIR
  → Validation
  → Policy rejection boundary
  → AI context
  → Authorized generation
  → Artifacts
  → Traceable evidence
```

The evidence is inspectable from the isolated run directory; the result is not dependent on a screenshot or an agent's claim about what happened.

The Golden Path does **not** itself claim production readiness, customer adoption, enterprise compliance, or safety of every external AI-agent integration.

The independent-verification capability is documented separately in [P1.11 — Independent Verifier CLI](control-plane/p1-11-independent-verifier-cli.md). P1.11 verifies a serialized canonical `EvidenceBundle` without re-running policy or executing an action; it is a verification capability supporting the broader proof path, not an additional Golden Path stage.

The repository CI executes the same demo script with an isolated temporary output directory, so the Golden Path is a regression gate rather than documentation-only. The CLI test suite also invokes the canonical script.

## Evidence map

| Stage | Repository input/output | What it demonstrates |
|---|---|---|
| Specification | `examples/demo-cli/spec.yaml` | Engineering intent is declared explicitly |
| NEIR | `examples/demo-cli/.run/inspect.json` | Intent is materialized into the canonical engineering representation |
| Validation | `validate.json` | The specification is checked before generation |
| Policy | `invalid-policy.log` | A disallowed configuration fails closed |
| AI Context | `context.md`, `context.json` | Agent-facing context is derived from the engineering model |
| Generation | `generated/` | The same specification drives project artifacts |
| Traceability | `run.json` | Run identity and specification/NEIR hashes connect execution to intent |
| Evidence | `summary.md` plus run metadata | The result is inspectable after the process completes |

## What the Golden Path does not claim

The demo is a reproducible engineering path, not a production deployment or benchmark. It does not by itself establish customer adoption, enterprise compliance, performance characteristics, or the safety of every external AI-agent integration.

Those claims require separate evidence and verification.

## Reuse

Use this path as the baseline for:

- technical evaluations and partner pilots;
- README and website onboarding;
- demonstrations of specification-driven AI engineering;
- regression testing of the control-plane contract;
- collecting reproducible evidence in GitHub issues or discussions.

When a feature changes the control-plane stages or their contracts, update the Golden Path and its acceptance criteria in the same change.

**Golden Path principle:** one engineering intent, one reproducible run, inspectable evidence from specification to generated artifact.

**Proof boundary:** the Golden Path proves the local control-plane workflow; P1.11 provides an independent read-only verification boundary for canonical evidence.
