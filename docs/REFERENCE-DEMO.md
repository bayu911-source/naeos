# NAEOS Reference Demo & Evidence Story

The Reference Demo is the externally consumable evidence narrative built on the canonical Golden Path. It answers one question:

> Can an engineer independently inspect how one declared engineering intent moves through NAEOS and becomes a generated artifact with traceable execution metadata?

This document is intentionally evidence-oriented. It describes what a reviewer can observe, how to reproduce it, and what the run does **not** prove.

## 1. Run the reference demo

From a clean checkout:

```bash
go build -o naeos ./cmd/naeos
NAEOS_DEMO_OUTPUT_DIR=/tmp/naeos-demo ./examples/demo-cli/run-demo.sh
```

The default path does not require an LLM API key. The optional AI compilation stage runs only when `NAEOS_LLM_API_KEY` is configured.

Inspect the resulting evidence set:

```bash
find /tmp/naeos-demo -maxdepth 3 -type f | sort
```

The canonical script fails if a required stage or expected artifact is missing.

## 2. Evidence chain

| Question | Evidence | Reviewer check |
|---|---|---|
| What was intended? | `spec.yaml` | Read the declared engineering intent |
| What representation did NAEOS derive? | `inspect.json` | Inspect the derived NEIR |
| Was the specification validated? | `validate.json` | Confirm validation output |
| Can policy reject a disallowed configuration? | `invalid-policy.log` | Confirm the deliberate policy failure |
| What context reaches an agent? | `context.md`, `context.json` | Compare generated context with the specification |
| What was executed? | `run.json` | Inspect run identity, stages, validation, policy, context, and audit metadata |
| What artifacts resulted? | `generated/` | Inspect generated project files |
| Can the result be summarized after execution? | `summary.md` | Confirm the evidence summary and artifact count |

## 3. Traceability contract

A successful reference run must expose:

- `run_id`
- `specification_hash`
- `neir_hash`
- validation metadata
- policy metadata
- context metadata
- audit metadata
- stage metadata

The hashes and run identifier are the minimum traceability anchors connecting the execution record to the declared engineering input and derived representation.

This is an inspectable contract, not a claim that every external system is automatically trustworthy.

## 4. Policy evidence

The demo intentionally submits an invalid policy configuration before the normal generation run.

The expected behavior is rejection with a policy-evaluation failure. This demonstrates the control-plane property that a policy decision can prevent a disallowed configuration from proceeding.

The test is deliberately local and deterministic; it should not be interpreted as proof of every policy boundary in every deployment.

## 5. Generation evidence

The successful run verifies the presence of representative generated files, including:

- `generated/README.md`
- `generated/go.mod`
- `generated/package.json`

The generated artifact set is counted and recorded in `summary.md`.

The important evidence relationship is:

```text
specification
     ↓
validated / represented
     ↓
policy checked
     ↓
context derived
     ↓
run executed
     ↓
artifacts + metadata
```

## 6. Independent reviewer checklist

A technical evaluator can use this sequence without trusting the documentation narrative:

1. Start from a clean checkout of the repository.
2. Build the CLI from source.
3. Run the canonical demo with an isolated output directory.
4. Confirm the script exits successfully.
5. Inspect `spec.yaml` and `inspect.json`.
6. Inspect the deliberate policy rejection in `invalid-policy.log`.
7. Inspect `run.json` and verify the required traceability fields.
8. Inspect `context.md` and `context.json`.
9. Inspect the generated project files.
10. Compare the observed result with the acceptance criteria in `docs/GOLDEN-PATH.md`.

The evaluator should treat the repository files and generated outputs as the primary evidence, rather than relying on screenshots or claims in this document.

### What this run proves

A successful reference run demonstrates the local control-plane path from declared engineering intent through validation, policy, context generation, authorized generation, artifacts, and traceable evidence. It does not establish production readiness, adoption, compliance, or the safety of arbitrary external agent integrations.

For the separate independent-verification capability, see [P1.11 — Independent Verifier CLI](control-plane/p1-11-independent-verifier-cli.md). P1.11 verifies a serialized canonical `EvidenceBundle` in read-only mode and is intentionally not presented as another demo path.

## 7. CI relationship

The Golden Path is already exercised by repository automation and the CLI test suite. That makes the reference demo a regression contract as well as a presentation path.

When a change modifies a control-plane stage or its output contract, the corresponding Golden Path acceptance criteria and evidence map should be reviewed in the same change.

## 8. Scope and non-claims

The Reference Demo establishes a reproducible engineering workflow and inspectable evidence artifacts.

It does **not** by itself establish:

- production deployment readiness;
- customer adoption;
- enterprise compliance;
- performance or scalability targets;
- security of every external AI provider or agent;
- correctness of arbitrary specifications;
- safety of every consequential external action.

Those properties require separate tests, deployment evidence, threat models, operational controls, and independent verification.

## 9. Partner-pilot use

For a technical pilot, use the same repository path and ask the evaluator to record:

- repository commit SHA;
- Go/toolchain version;
- demo command;
- demo exit status;
- generated artifact count;
- `run_id`;
- `specification_hash`;
- `neir_hash`;
- observed policy rejection;
- any deviations from the acceptance criteria.

This produces a compact, reproducible evidence record that can be attached to a GitHub issue, discussion, or partner evaluation report.

## 10. Evidence principle

**Do not ask the reviewer to trust the claim when the repository can expose the evidence.**

The Reference Demo therefore prioritizes:

```text
Declared intent
    ↓
Inspectable representation
    ↓
Explicit policy decision
    ↓
Observable execution
    ↓
Traceable artifacts
    ↓
Independent review
```

The Golden Path proves the runnable sequence. The Reference Demo makes the resulting evidence legible to an external engineer.
