# NAEOS-CAM-001 — Day 02 Runtime Evidence Record

**Experiment:** EXP-002 — Atomic Execution Commit Boundary  
**Campaign:** NAEOS-CAM-001 — 30 Days of AI Agent Governance  
**Status:** Verified runtime evidence  
**Evidence source:** GitHub Actions CI run `37148852234`

## Question

What happens when a policy update races with an already-authorized execution at the check-to-side-effect boundary?

## Reproduction

```text
go run ./examples/control-plane-atomic-execution
```

## Observed Runtime Result

The Day 02 CI job completed successfully on:

- **Environment:** Ubuntu 24.04.5 LTS
- **Go:** 1.26.6
- **Workflow run:** 37148852234
- **PR merge ref tested:** 6cf91b06ec792a0c15c007517c94f6ef09d53de4
- **Timestamp:** 2026-10-03T19:42:29Z
- **Experiment exit code:** 0
- **Result:** `P1.8 RESULT: initial=ALLOW execution=ALLOW verification=PASS`

## Evidence Artifact

The CI job uploaded the runtime evidence artifact successfully:

- **Artifact:** `day2-atomic-execution-evidence-6cf91b06ec792a0c15c007517c94f6ef09d53de4`
- **Artifact ID:** 11283395285
- **Files uploaded:** 2
- **Artifact size:** 471 bytes
- **Artifact ZIP SHA-256:** `83819da343d3761a74508bb9a802a4457ef96862d3fddc495ca43ae56382b5ac`

## Acceptance Results

| Criterion | Result |
|---|---|
| Policy v1 active | PASS |
| `repository.write` authorization | ALLOW |
| Atomic execution boundary entered | PASS |
| Authorized side effect executed | PASS |
| Concurrent policy update serialized | PASS |
| Execution evidence recorded | `EXECUTION_ALLOWED` / verification PASS |
| Authorization bound to policy v1 | PASS |
| Policy v2 becomes active after execution | PASS |
| Independent session verification | PASS |
| Regression protection for check-to-side-effect boundary | PASS |

The CI workflow also passed **CI Gate**, including the dedicated **Day 02 Atomic Execution Evidence** job.

## Integrity Statement

This record is based on the actual GitHub Actions runtime log and uploaded artifact metadata. No local runtime result has been substituted for CI evidence.

The evidence demonstrates the tested **in-process atomic execution control-plane property**. It does **not** by itself prove distributed transaction semantics, external-system atomicity, consensus across policy stores, production security, compliance, or universal AI-agent safety.

## Independent Reproduction

Run:

```bash
go run ./examples/control-plane-atomic-execution
```

Compare the observed result with the invariant documented in:

```text
docs/experiments/EXP-002-atomic-execution-commit-boundary.md
```

## Record Finalization

This record was prepared after the Day 02 CI evidence job completed successfully and before the evidence document was merged into `main`.
