# NAEOS Roadmap

> **Operational roadmap — September 2026**
>
> This file is the public execution navigator. Normative roadmap authority remains
> NAEOS-GOV-007, while the executable development plan is NAEOS-RDP-001.

## Current baseline

- **Current documented release:** NAEOS 3.6.0 (VERSION)
- **Core direction:** Engineering Control Plane for AI Coding Agents
- **Canonical model:** Specification → NEIR → Validation + Policy → Agent Intent → Authorized Execution → Observation → Evidence → Independent Verification
- **Repository proof path:** Golden Path → Reference Demo → External Validation → Independent Verification
- **Current engineering milestone:** **P1.11 — Independent Verifier CLI — DONE**
- **Next execution track:** **Adoption Engineering**
- **Primary public surface:** /control-plane on the NAEOS website

NAEOS has implemented substantial policy, control-plane, runtime, evidence,
verification, observability, signing, SBOM, plugin, and production-server
capabilities. The current priority is therefore **proof, reproducibility,
adoption, and real-world evaluation**, not unrelated feature expansion.

## Completed engineering milestones

### P1.6 — Public Control Plane — DONE

The public control-plane proof established a side-effect-free browser path for
real authorization decisions.

- [x] Real control-plane decision endpoint
- [x] Public website Control Plane page
- [x] Explicit CORS allowlisting
- [x] Rate and request-size limits
- [x] Optional server-to-server authentication
- [x] Side-effect-free public decision path
- [x] Production deployment
- [x] Website CSP permits the control-plane endpoint
- [x] Browser-level ALLOW proof
- [x] Browser-level DENY proof
- [x] Public evidence walkthrough
- [x] Documentation synchronized

Reference: docs/control-plane/live-proof.md

### P1.7 — Policy Change Mid-Run — DONE

The governance/control boundary demonstrates that policy changes do not silently
invalidate or bypass the decision state already governing an active run.

### P1.8 — Atomic Execution Commit Boundary — DONE

The execution boundary preserves the atomic relationship between authorization
and the committed execution transition.

### P1.11 — Independent Verifier CLI — DONE

P1.11 adds a verifier-facing CLI for canonical serialized EvidenceBundle records.

- [x] `naeos evidence verify-bundle --input-file <bundle.json>`
- [x] Decision/execution identity binding verification
- [x] Evidence digest recomputation
- [x] Table and JSON verification output
- [x] Non-zero exit on verification failure
- [x] Valid and tampered bundle tests
- [x] Read-only verifier with no live control-plane dependency
- [x] Independent verifier documentation

The merged implementation is PR #384.

## Track 1 — Five-minute developer onboarding

**Status: ACTIVE**

The repository has a canonical CLI Golden Path. The next step is to make the
public control-plane proof, local Golden Path, Reference Demo, and independent
verification feel like one coherent onboarding journey.

- [x] Canonical CLI demo
- [x] Golden Path acceptance contract
- [x] Reference Demo evidence story
- [x] External Validation runbook
- [x] Independent EvidenceBundle verifier
- [x] Link public Control Plane → Golden Path → Reference Demo → Verifier through the Verified Golden Path navigator
- [ ] Verify fresh-checkout onboarding on the current release
- [x] Remove duplicate onboarding routes from START-HERE
- [x] Add one concise "what you just proved" explanation

- START-HERE.md

## Track 2 — Documentation Truth Sync

**Status: ACTIVE**

Public documentation must agree with the current repository state. The
normative hierarchy remains authoritative; public navigators should point to it
rather than reproduce competing roadmaps.

- [x] README states current release and control-plane positioning
- [x] START-HERE defines the supported first-run path
- [x] Golden Path defines reproducible acceptance criteria
- [x] Reference Demo defines the evidence narrative
- [x] External Validation defines independent evaluation
- [x] Independent verifier documented
- [x] Whitepapers identify repository version 3.6.0
- [x] Top-level roadmap reflects completed P1 milestones
- [ ] Audit public website copy against the canonical positioning
- [ ] Audit roadmap/version references for stale phase language
- [ ] Ensure release notes, website, README, and whitepaper distinguish
      software releases from experiment milestones

## Track 3 — Adoption Engineering

**Status: ACTIVE**

The Verified Golden Path is now the canonical adoption spine. The next measurable outcome is reproducible usage by technical evaluators, not additional feature surface.

Goal: turn technical proof into repeatable developer adoption.

~~~text
Public proof
    ↓
Developer runs NAEOS
    ↓
Developer verifies the evidence
    ↓
Developer understands the control boundary
    ↓
Developer challenges / contributes
    ↓
Developer becomes evaluator
~~~

Targets:

- [ ] Clear Developer / Contributor / Organization entry points
- [ ] One copy-paste public demo path
- [x] Evidence Query UX contract and evaluator query examples
- [x] Issue template for external validation reports
- [ ] First cohort of technical evaluators
- [ ] Capture reproducible deviations and failure modes
- [ ] Convert repeated evaluator needs into engineering work

Success should be measured by **reproducible usage and technical feedback**, not
only traffic, followers, or impressions.

The evaluator intake path is now explicit: run the Golden Path from a fixed commit,
record the evidence anchors, report deviations, and open an `External Validation
Report` issue. The first evaluator cohort remains an adoption outcome, not a
self-reported milestone.

## Track 4 — Design Partner Pilot

**Status: AFTER ADOPTION EVIDENCE**

Start with a narrow boundary rather than a full enterprise deployment:

~~~text
1 team
  ↓
1 repository
  ↓
1 AI-agent workflow
  ↓
1 consequential control boundary
  ↓
policy → authorization → execution → evidence → verification
~~~

Pilot questions:

1. Can the team define a meaningful policy boundary?
2. Can the agent request an action without becoming the authority?
3. Can NAEOS deterministically allow or deny the action?
4. Can the runtime enforce the decision?
5. Can the team inspect evidence afterward?
6. Can an independent verifier validate the resulting claim?

Do not expand the pilot scope until these questions produce concrete evidence.

## Track 5 — Ecosystem / P2

**Status: GATED BY ADOPTION EVIDENCE**

Potential areas:

- agent adapters and protocol-neutral handoffs
- plugin/extension ecosystem
- durable evidence and verification integrations
- organization-level governance
- operational dashboards
- compliance workflows
- enterprise deployment patterns

The order should be driven by observed evaluator and pilot requirements, not by
feature volume.

## Strategic sequence

## What we deliberately do not optimize for yet

- A large dashboard before real users require it
- Provider-specific AI features that weaken vendor neutrality
- Generic AI marketing claims without repository evidence
- Enterprise packaging before a repeatable technical pilot
- Feature expansion that makes the core control boundary harder to explain

## Source-of-truth rules

When documents disagree:

1. Follow the normative hierarchy in DOCUMENTATION-AUTHORITY.md.
2. Treat NAEOS-GOV-007 as the stable strategic roadmap.
3. Treat NAEOS-RDP-001 as the executable development-plan reference.
4. Treat this file as the current public execution navigator.
5. Treat CHANGELOG.md and VERSION as the release-history sources.

**Roadmap principle:** prove the control boundary, make it reproducible, then
earn adoption before scaling the ecosystem.
