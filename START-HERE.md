# Start Here

You do not need to read the whole NAEOS architecture before you can understand the value. The shortest path is: understand the problem, run one example, and then decide whether to contribute.

NAEOS is a platform for turning a system specification into a shared engineering model that can be validated, generated, and used by AI tools without drifting away from the actual design.

## Coming from the NAEOS newsletter?

If you arrived here from a newsletter, article, or community post, start here:

1. Understand the problem.
2. Inspect one real example.
3. Run one experiment.
4. Challenge one assumption.
5. Make one small contribution.

This is the bridge between reading about NAEOS and participating in the repository.

## 1. What is NAEOS?

NAEOS helps teams keep architecture, implementation, and AI context aligned by using a software specification as the source of truth. Instead of letting documentation, prompts, and generated code drift apart, the system builds a shared engineering model and validates it before generating artifacts.

The practical question is simple: when an AI agent takes action, how do we know it is still operating against the current design, policy, and scope? NAEOS is built around that problem.

## 2. Why should I care?

Imagine an AI coding agent is asked to make a change. It uses a prior plan, a stale policy, and a local understanding of the project. Then the system requirements change: a module boundary is tightened, a security rule is added, or an authorization policy is revised.

The engineering question is simple: should the old plan still run?

NAEOS is built around that question. It treats the specification as the source of truth and evaluates validation and policy before generating artifacts.

## 3. See the public control boundary

Before running locally, you can inspect the public Control Plane at [naeos.dev/control-plane](https://naeos.dev/control-plane/). It evaluates authorization requests against the deployed NAEOS control-plane engine and is intentionally side-effect-free.

Use it to understand the public control boundary first; then reproduce the engineering workflow locally with the Golden Path below.

## 4. Try it in 5 minutes

The most direct, verified onboarding path in this repository is the canonical CLI demo in [examples/demo-cli/README.md](examples/demo-cli/README.md) and its script at [examples/demo-cli/run-demo.sh](examples/demo-cli/run-demo.sh).

This is the repository’s single supported first-run flow:

```bash
go build -o naeos ./cmd/naeos
./examples/demo-cli/run-demo.sh
```

The formal [NAEOS Golden Path](docs/GOLDEN-PATH.md) defines the acceptance criteria and evidence map for this same flow.

For an external technical evaluation, use the [Reference Demo & Evidence Story](docs/REFERENCE-DEMO.md). It turns the same run into an independent reviewer checklist and traceability narrative. For a reproducible third-party review, use the [External Validation Runbook](docs/EXTERNAL-VALIDATION.md) to record the commit, environment, evidence anchors, acceptance results, and deviations.

What to expect:
- the specification is validated
- NEIR is materialized and inspected
- policy evaluation is exercised, including deterministic rejection of invalid configuration
- an AI context bundle is generated
- a valid run produces generated artifacts
- run metadata records traceability (`run_id`, `specification_hash`, `neir_hash`)

This is the best first check because it demonstrates the real NAEOS control-plane workflow without requiring the full architecture first.

If you want to go one step further with the AI compiler:

```bash
naeos ai compile --input-file examples/demo-cli/spec.yaml --target opencode
```

The default demo intentionally does not require an LLM API key.

## 5. Run the governance experiment

After the five-minute CLI demo, run the flagship governance lifecycle experiment:

```bash
go run ./experiments/governance-lifecycle
```

It tests the chain `agent intent → policy decision → execution → observation → evidence → independent verification` and deliberately treats an agent's claim as different from observed evidence. See [experiments/governance-lifecycle/README.md](experiments/governance-lifecycle/README.md).

## 6. Understand the architecture

The repository’s conceptual architecture is summarized in [README.md](README.md) and [ARCHITECTURE-OVERVIEW.md](ARCHITECTURE-OVERVIEW.md). For normative authority and conflict resolution, use [DOCUMENTATION-AUTHORITY.md](DOCUMENTATION-AUTHORITY.md).

The short version is:

```text
Specification
  ↓
Parse → Normalize → Resolve
  ↓
Build NEIR
  ↓
Validate → Policy → AI context
  ↓
Generate artifacts and engineering outputs
```

If you want the authoritative references, use [DOCUMENTATION-AUTHORITY.md](DOCUMENTATION-AUTHORITY.md) first, then:

- [NAEOS-NRA-001](Reference%20Architecture/NAEOS-NRA-001.md)
- [NAEOS-MTS-001](NAEOS-MTS-001.md)
- [specification/NAEOS-SPEC-001.md](specification/NAEOS-SPEC-001.md)
- [docs/NES-023-NEIR.md](docs/NES-023-NEIR.md)
- [docs/NES-028-CLI-Reference.md](docs/NES-028-CLI-Reference.md)

## 7. Pick your path

### I want to understand NAEOS

Start with:

- [README.md](README.md)
- [GETTING-STARTED.md](GETTING-STARTED.md)
- [specification/NAEOS-SPEC-001.md](specification/NAEOS-SPEC-001.md)
- [ARCHITECTURE-OVERVIEW.md](ARCHITECTURE-OVERVIEW.md)

### I want to run NAEOS

Use:

- [GETTING-STARTED.md](GETTING-STARTED.md)
- [docs/GOLDEN-PATH.md](docs/GOLDEN-PATH.md)
- [docs/REFERENCE-DEMO.md](docs/REFERENCE-DEMO.md)
- [examples/demo-cli/README.md](examples/demo-cli/README.md)
- [docs/NES-028-CLI-Reference.md](docs/NES-028-CLI-Reference.md)

Verified local path:

```bash
go build -o naeos ./cmd/naeos
./examples/demo-cli/run-demo.sh
```

### I want to inspect the architecture

Read:

- [ARCHITECTURE-OVERVIEW.md](ARCHITECTURE-OVERVIEW.md)
- [docs/NES-023-NEIR.md](docs/NES-023-NEIR.md)
- [docs/NES-026-Pipeline.md](docs/NES-026-Pipeline.md)
- [docs/NES-027-Governance.md](docs/NES-027-Governance.md)

### I want to challenge the design

This is a valuable contribution. Ask questions such as:

- What assumption does the current pipeline make that fails in the real world?
- Where does stale context survive validation?
- Where does policy enforcement rely on incomplete metadata?
- What happens when authority or scope changes mid-run?

The repository’s discussion workflow is described in [docs/community/discussions.md](docs/community/discussions.md). A focused technical question is often the best way to start.

### I want to contribute code

Start with [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), then look for an issue or a concrete gap. The repository includes issue templates in [.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) and a contributor ladder in [docs/community/contributor-ladder.md](docs/community/contributor-ladder.md).

### I want to contribute documentation

Good first documentation work includes clarifying the onboarding path, fixing broken or confusing links, and improving the examples used by new visitors. This is often the easiest first step.

### I want to experiment with AI agents

Look at the pipeline and compiler docs, the demo, and the AI context generation flow. The best concrete starting point is the local demo plus the compiler references in [README.md](README.md) and [docs/NES-028-CLI-Reference.md](docs/NES-028-CLI-Reference.md).

## 8. Start with a small contribution

The easiest successful contribution is not “build a large feature.” It is “improve one small, concrete thing that makes the project easier to understand or use.”

### 15 minutes

Examples of good early work:

- clarify a confusing section in onboarding docs
- identify a broken link or stale path
- reproduce a limitation and document the exact steps
- review a policy scenario and ask whether the behavior is consistent
- improve one example or one command snippet

### 1 hour

Examples:

- add or improve a test around a pipeline or validation behavior
- improve a minimal example or demo output
- document an edge case in the CLI workflow
- tighten a small piece of architecture or policy documentation

### Deeper contribution

These are real areas of the repository and are appropriate once the basics are understood:

- architecture and pipeline work
- validation and policy work
- NEIR and compiler behavior
- runtime and execution semantics
- migration or schema work
- plugin and profile integration
- security and evidence-oriented review

The contributor ladder in [docs/community/contributor-ladder.md](docs/community/contributor-ladder.md) is the best guide for how these contributions fit together.

## 9. Challenge NAEOS

A healthy NAEOS contribution is not just “add more features.” It is also challenging the assumptions the project currently makes.

The most valuable questions are about failure modes and edge cases:

- policy bypass or stale authorization
- inconsistent or delayed validation
- replay or stale artifact reuse
- authority changes mid-run
- handoff manipulation between tools or agents
- verification gaps or evidence gaps

This is not anti-project work. It is exactly the kind of work that makes a governance and AI engineering system more trustworthy.

If you see a gap, ask: “What assumption does NAEOS currently make that may not hold in the real world?”

## 10. Good first issues

The repository has a curated set of concrete contributor starting points. Each issue is intentionally scoped so a new contributor can inspect the relevant code or documentation before writing a large change:

- [#209 — Improve policy evaluator edge-case coverage](https://github.com/NAEOS-foundation/naeos/issues/209)
- [#210 — Add audit evidence for disabled policy rules](https://github.com/NAEOS-foundation/naeos/issues/210)
- [#211 — Document the NAEOS contribution workflow](https://github.com/NAEOS-foundation/naeos/issues/211)
- [#212 — Strengthen experiment evidence format](https://github.com/NAEOS-foundation/naeos/issues/212)
- [#213 — Review plugin registry contributor path](https://github.com/NAEOS-foundation/naeos/issues/213)

Use [.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) for new bug reports, documentation work, feature requests, plugin contributions, or other concrete gaps.

## 11. Contribution workflow

The repository now has a curated set of concrete contributor starting points. Pick one based on the kind of work you want to do:

- [#209 — Improve policy evaluator edge-case coverage](https://github.com/NAEOS-foundation/naeos/issues/209) — focused tests for NaN/Inf, empty conditions, nil, and whitespace behavior.
- [#210 — Add audit evidence for disabled policy rules](https://github.com/NAEOS-foundation/naeos/issues/210) — make disabled policy rules observable instead of silently bypassed.
- [#211 — Document the NAEOS contribution workflow](https://github.com/NAEOS-foundation/naeos/issues/211) — improve the path from repository orientation to a first Issue/PR.
- [#212 — Strengthen experiment evidence format](https://github.com/NAEOS-foundation/naeos/issues/212) — establish a consistent, independently inspectable evidence structure.
- [#213 — Review plugin registry contributor path](https://github.com/NAEOS-foundation/naeos/issues/213) — verify the smallest end-to-end plugin contribution path.

These are intentionally scoped so a new contributor can inspect the relevant code or documentation before writing a large change. If none fits, use the issue templates to propose a concrete problem or documentation gap.

The simplest accurate contribution flow is:

1. Clone the repository and read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
2. Pick a concrete issue, question, or documentation gap.
3. Make a small change with a clear explanation.
4. Run the relevant tests or validation commands.
5. Open a pull request and explain what changed and why.

This repository already defines the engineering workflow in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). The intent here is to make the first step feel approachable.

## 13. Join the discussion

If you have a technical question, a design idea, or a project you built with NAEOS, use GitHub Discussions and the issue templates rather than silently watching. The repository already defines the community structure in [docs/community/discussions.md](docs/community/discussions.md).

A strong first discussion usually contains:

- a short problem statement
- the exact command or workflow you tried
- the actual output or failure mode
- the question you are asking

This is more useful than a vague “this seems broken” note.

## 14. The NAEOS principle

NAEOS should not merely make AI agents more capable. It should make their actions more understandable, governable, verifiable, and trustworthy.

That is the project’s real starting point: not a faster code generator, but a more disciplined engineering layer for AI-assisted work.
