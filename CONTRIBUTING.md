## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.26.6 or later
- Git
- golangci-lint (required — runs in CI and blocks PRs)

### Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NAEOS-foundation/naeos.git
cd naeos
go mod tidy
go build ./cmd/naeos/
go test ./...
```

## External Contributor Path

For a first contribution, use this bounded path:

1. Start from [START-HERE.md](START-HERE.md) and run the canonical Golden Path.
2. Record the commit, command, environment, expected result, and observed result.
3. For a reproducibility or documentation finding, open a focused issue with the relevant evidence.
4. For a design question or architectural challenge, use the documented [discussion workflow](docs/community/discussions.md).
5. For a code change, keep the PR scoped to one problem and include the tests or verification performed.

When reporting a failure, include the smallest reproducible command and the relevant output. Do not report an issue as a product defect solely from an agent's claim; distinguish observed behavior from interpretation.

## Development Workflow

### Build

```bash
go build ./cmd/naeos/
```

### Test

```bash
# All tests with race detector
go test -race -count=1 -timeout 300s ./...

# Specific package
go test -race -count=1 -timeout 60s ./internal/broker/...

# With coverage
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
go tool cover -html=coverage.out

# Integration-tagged E2E tests
go test -tags=integration -race -count=1 -timeout 120s ./pkg/pipeline/ -run "TestEndToEnd"
```

### Lint

```bash
golangci-lint run ./...
go vet ./...
```

### Fuzz

```bash
go test -fuzz=FuzzParseVersion -fuzztime=30s ./internal/migration/
go test -fuzz=FuzzParse -fuzztime=30s ./internal/specification/parser/
```

### Benchmarks

```bash
go test -bench=. -benchmem ./internal/compiler/...
go test -bench=. -benchmem ./internal/generation/adapters/...
```

### Generate CLI Docs

```bash
go run ./cmd/naeos/ docsgen
# Output: docs/cli/*.md
```

### Generate Test Skeletons

```bash
go run ./cmd/gentest/ -pkg ./internal/my-package/ -o ./internal/my-package/new_test.go
```

### E2E Test Script

```bash
./scripts/e2e_test.sh
```

## Code Style

### Go Conventions

- Format: `gofmt` + `goimports` with local prefix `github.com/NAEOS-foundation/naeos`
- Import order: stdlib → third-party → internal
- Error handling: return errors, no panics
- Thread safety: use `sync.Mutex`/`sync.RWMutex` + `atomic.Int64`
- Constructor pattern: `New*()` returns struct pointer (not interface)
- Config pattern: constructor takes config struct, validates and stores copy
- Logging: structured via middleware, not inline
- No external logging or assertion libraries

### Naming

| Convention | Example |
|---|---|
| File names | `snake_case.go` |
| Test files | `*_test.go` in same package |
| External test files | `*_ext_test.go` with `package xxx_test` |
| Table-driven loop var | Always `tt` |

## Testing Guide

### Test Patterns

**Basic test:**
```go
func TestFunction(t *testing.T) {
    result := DoSomething()
    if result != expected {
        t.Errorf("got %v, want %v", result, expected)
    }
}
```

**Table-driven (use `tt` as loop variable):**
```go
func TestCompare(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name string
        a, b string
        want int
    }{
        {name: "a < b", a: "a", b: "b", want: -1},
    }
    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            got := Compare(tt.a, tt.b)
            if got != tt.want {
                t.Errorf("Compare(%q, %q) = %d, want %d", tt.a, tt.b, got, tt.want)
            }
        })
    }
}
```

**Constructor test:**
```go
func TestNewThing(t *testing.T) {
    t.Parallel()
    s := NewThing()
    if s == nil {
        t.Fatal("expected non-nil")
    }
}
```

**Error expected:**
```go
_, err := Parse("invalid")
if err == nil {
    t.Fatal("expected error")
}
```

**Temp directories:**
```go
dir := t.TempDir()
path := filepath.Join(dir, "file.txt")
os.WriteFile(path, []byte("data"), 0644)
```

**Concurrent test:**
```go
func TestConcurrentAccess(t *testing.T) {
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
        wg.Add(1)
        go func() {
            defer wg.Done()
            // concurrent operations
        }()
    }
    wg.Wait()
}
```

git commit -m "docs: update CLI reference"
```

## License

NAEOS is released under the [Apache License 2.0](LICENSE). Unless you state
otherwise, any contribution you intentionally submit for inclusion in the work
is licensed to NAEOS under the same terms (inbound = outbound), consistent with
Section 5 of the Apache License. Do not submit code you do not have the right
to contribute.

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

Every commit must include a `Signed-off-by` trailer:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

Use `git commit -s` to add it automatically. By signing off, you certify that,
per the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/):

1. You authored the contribution, or received it from a prior contributor who
   authored it, and it does not incorporate unlicensed third-party material.
2. You have the right to submit it for inclusion in this project.

The DCO check (`.github/workflows/dco.yml`) verifies every commit in a pull
request and is required by the `main` branch ruleset. If you contribute on
behalf of an employer, client, or other party, make sure that party has granted
you the right to contribute under the Apache License 2.0. NAEOS does not
require copyright assignment through the DCO; the DCO records the contributor's
certification that they have the right to submit the contribution.

If your contribution includes work created as an employee, contractor,
freelancer, or agency representative, confirm that the applicable agreement or
rights holder permits submission under Apache-2.0. Do not publish contracts,
employer approvals, or other confidential evidence in a pull request; contact
the maintainers if a private rights question needs review.

Document reused third-party code, text, examples, specifications, or assets in
the pull request and identify their source and license. Do not rely on a
publicly accessible URL as proof that material can be redistributed. For
generated material, identify the generator and relevant source/template when
that information is material to establishing provenance.

## AI-Assisted Contributions

AI-assisted and agent-generated contributions are welcome. You remain
responsible for the rights to every line you submit, whether written by hand or
produced by a tool, and for keeping secrets and third-party material out of the
repository. For substantial AI-generated or agent-generated content, add a
brief provenance note to the pull request describing the affected files or
content, the tool or generator, and relevant source material. Do not include
private prompts, confidential inputs, personal data, or secrets. Routine
editorial assistance does not require disclosure. See the
[AI-assisted contribution provenance policy](docs/ai-provenance.md) for the
full guidance.

## Security

Never commit secrets: API keys, tokens, passwords, private keys, cloud
credentials, `.env` files, or personal/customer data — even in tests or
examples. Review your diff for accidental secrets before pushing; if a secret
is found in history, rotate it and contact the maintainers. Prefer
[`.env.example`](.env.example) with placeholder values for any documented
configuration.

## Pull Request Process

1. **Branch** from `main` with a descriptive name
2. **Commit** with clear messages (imperative mood, <72 chars)
3. **Test** — run full suite: `go test -race -count=1 -timeout 300s ./...`
4. **Lint** — run: `golangci-lint run ./... && go vet ./...`
5. **PR** — describe the change, why it's needed, and how it was tested
