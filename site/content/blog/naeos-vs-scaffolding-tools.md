Scaffolding tools are everywhere. Yeoman, Hygen, Cookie Cutter, Copier, OpenAPI Gen — every language community has one. They're useful, they're proven, and they all share the same fundamental limitation: **they operate at the file level, not the system level.**

This post compares NAEOS against the five tools teams most commonly reach for, and explains why we believe spec-driven generation is the next step beyond template-driven generation.

## The Landscape

| Tool | Language | Approach | What it generates |
|------|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **NAEOS** | Go | Spec-driven (YAML/JSON → NEIR model) | Full multi-language projects, AI context, governance, deployment artifacts |
| **Cookie Cutter** | Python | Jinja templates | Project skeletons |
| **Copier** | Python | Project templates with answers | Project skeletons, updates |
| **OpenAPI Gen** | Java/TS | OpenAPI → code | API clients/servers only |
| **Hygen** | Node.js | Code snippets | Individual files |
| **Yeoman** | Node.js | Generators | Project skeletons, files |

## The File-Level Trap

Every template tool works the same way: you run the generator, it renders files from templates, and the output is done. The files are correct — for the moment they're generated.

The problem is what happens *between* generations:

- Your Go service uses one error format; your TypeScript client expects another. Nothing links them.
- The Terraform config refers to resources by naming conventions that only work if generators run in the right order.
- A developer hand-edits a generated file; the next generation silently overwrites it, or worse, silently doesn't.
- Six AI assistants need six different context files, each maintained by hand.

These are **file-level artifacts without system awareness**. Each one is correct in isolation; together they drift.

## What NAEOS Does Differently

NAEOS doesn't render templates — it **builds a model and derives everything from it**:

1. You write one specification (YAML/JSON): modules, dependencies, services, endpoints, architecture pattern, deployment strategy, testing targets.
2. The pipeline parses, resolves, and validates it into **NEIR** — the NAEOS Engineering Intermediate Representation — a canonical model of the entire system.
3. Language adapters derive code from that model: Go, TypeScript, Python, Java, Rust from the *same* model, with the same validation, the same dependency graph, the same structural guarantees.
4. AI compilers derive context for Copilot, Claude, Cursor, Gemini, Codex, OpenCode, and Windsurf from the same model.
5. Policy rules evaluate the model *before* generation. Governance executes, instead of living in a PDF.

The difference is not the output — it's the **source of truth**. Templates capture what a project looked like once. A specification captures what the system is, and everything is derived from it, every time, deterministically.

## Head-to-Head

| Capability | NAEOS | Cookie Cutter | Copier | OpenAPI Gen | Hygen | Yeoman |
|------------|-------|---------------|--------|-------------|-------|--------|
| Declarative spec (YAML/JSON) | **Yes** | Partial | Partial | Partial | No | No |
| Multi-language generation (5) | **Yes** | Any (your templates) | Any | API only | No | Per-generator |
| AI context generation (7 platforms) | **Yes** | — | — | — | — | — |
| Pipeline engine (11-stage DAG) | **Yes** | — | — | — | — | — |
| Built-in governance (RBAC + audit) | **Yes** | — | — | — | — | — |
| WASM plugin system | **Yes** | Jinja only | Jinja only | — | JS snippets | JS generators |
| Template marketplace | **Yes** | Third-party | — | — | — | npm |
| Interactive dashboard | **Yes** | — | — | — | — | — |
| Watch mode | **Yes** | — | — | — | Yes | Yes |
| CI/CD integration | **Native** | Manual | Manual | Manual | Manual | Manual |
| SSO (OIDC/SAML/LDAP) | **Built-in** | — | — | — | — | — |
| Compliance (SOC 2/HIPAA/GDPR) | **Built-in** | — | — | — | — | — |

## When to Use What

Honest answer: templates are still the right tool for many jobs.

- **One-off skeleton generation** — a new service in one language, no cross-cutting concerns? Hygen or Yeoman is perfectly fine.
- **Internal standardization of a single stack** — Cookie Cutter and Copier are proven and lightweight.
- **Full-stack, multi-language systems with governance needs** — this is where NAEOS earns its complexity. Microservices, AI-assisted development, enterprise compliance, teams that need the spec to be the source of truth.

## The Takeaway

Template tools answer the question "what files should exist?" NAEOS answers a harder question: "what *is* this system?" Every artifact — code, configs, docs, AI context, deployment manifests — is derived from that answer.

Templates produce files. NAEOS produces systems. [Try it](/download/) and see the difference on your next project.
