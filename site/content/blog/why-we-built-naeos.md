Every engineering team knows the feeling. The documentation says one thing, the code says another, and the newest engineer on the team spends their first weeks reverse-engineering the system instead of building on it.

This isn't a process failure. It's a structural one. And it's the reason we built NAEOS.

## The Fragmentation Problem

Modern software systems are built from pieces that never quite agree with each other:

- **Multiple languages and frameworks.** A typical product ships Go services, a TypeScript frontend, Python tooling, and maybe Java or Rust infrastructure — each with its own conventions, its own boilerplate, its own drift.
- **Specification–implementation drift.** Documentation and code diverge over time, and no automated mechanism guarantees they stay aligned. The spec says hexagonal; the code is a mess of entangled layers.
- **Lost engineering context.** Architecture decisions live in ADRs and in people's heads — undocumented, untraceable, and gone when the person leaves.
- **An explosion of AI tools.** Six coding assistants, six different context formats. Teams maintain duplicate instruction files for Copilot, Claude, Cursor, and friends — and they still drift out of date.
- **Governance that never executes.** Policies exist as static documents. Nothing in the pipeline enforces them.

The cost is rework, expensive audits, painful migrations, knowledge loss, and compliance failures — all of it compounding silently.

## The Thesis

NAEOS is built on one claim:

> **The specification is the single source of truth. Everything — code, documentation, configuration, AI context, deployment artifacts — must be derived from the specification through a deterministic, validated, auditable pipeline.**

That sentence is the entire product. NAEOS (Nusantara AI Engineering Operating System) is a declarative engineering runtime that takes a YAML/JSON specification and runs it through an 11-stage pipeline: parse, normalize, resolve, build NEIR, validate, build graph, evaluate policy, schedule, generate, review, and write artifacts.

Everything downstream is derived from one model — the **NEIR** (NAEOS Engineering Intermediate Representation) — a canonical, versioned representation of your system spanning modules, services, architecture patterns, APIs, storage, security, AI targets, and deployment. No independent generators drifting apart. One model, many adapters.

## Why We Believe It Works

Three things happened after we committed to this thesis:

**1. Drift became structurally impossible.** When Go services and TypeScript clients are generated from the same NEIR model, they cannot silently disagree about error formats, API contracts, or naming conventions. Consistency isn't a review checklist anymore — it's a build invariant.

**2. AI assistants finally got real context.** The same NEIR model compiles into instruction sets for GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Codex, OpenCode, and Windsurf. Your AI tools stop reading isolated files and start reading the architecture — dependencies, patterns, boundaries, and intent.

**3. Governance became executable.** Policy rules evaluate the NEIR model before a single line is generated. Violations are caught at the specification level, not in code review. RBAC, audit trails, and compliance-oriented policy templates can be applied through the pipeline.

## Where We Are Now

The current repository state is **v3.6.0** and includes:

- **5 languages** — Go, TypeScript, Python, Java, Rust — from one specification
- **7 AI platforms** — instruction sets compiled from the NEIR model
- **200+ CLI commands** — run, validate, test, watch, diff, deploy, cloud, serve, and more
- **57 NES documents** — a specification-driven project, documented like it builds
- **WASM plugin marketplace** — sandboxed, third-party extensions
- **Schema registry, policy engine, MCP server, LSP server, dashboard** — an operating system for engineering, not a code generator

## What's Next

We're working toward the ecosystem release targets: a richer plugin marketplace, deeper compliance integrations, distributed builds, and tighter editor integrations. The roadmap is public — [ROADMAP.md](https://github.com/NAEOS-foundation/naeos/blob/main/ROADMAP.md) — and we'd love your help shaping it.

## Try It

The fastest way to understand NAEOS is to build something:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://naeos.dev/install.sh | sh
naeos create
naeos run --input-file spec.yaml
```

One specification. Five languages. A clearer path for reducing drift. [Read the whitepaper](/whitepaper/) for the full thesis, and join us on [GitHub](https://github.com/NAEOS-foundation/naeos).

We built NAEOS because we believe engineering can be more declarative, more transparent, and more structured for humans and for AI. Architecture Drives Engineering.
