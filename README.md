NAEOS is an open-source engineering framework for building production software with AI coding agents. It provides the engineering layer between **what a team intends**, **what an agent proposes**, **what is authorized to execute**, and **what can be independently verified afterward**.

It is not another AI coding assistant. NAEOS is the control plane around the agent.

## Why NAEOS?

AI coding agents can generate code quickly. Production engineering still requires explicit answers to harder questions:

- What architecture is the agent operating within?
- Which actions are allowed?
- Who or what authorizes an external side effect?
- What actually happened during execution?
- What evidence proves the result?
- Can another system independently verify the claim?
- Can the same engineering intent be carried across different AI agents?

NAEOS treats these as engineering-system concerns rather than prompt-writing concerns.

## The model

Without an engineering control plane:

```text
Prompt → AI Agent → Code / Action → ?
```

With NAEOS:

```text
Specification
      ↓
NEIR
      ↓
Validation + Policy
      ↓
Agent Context / Intent
      ↓
Authorized Execution
      ↓
Observation → Evidence
      ↓
Independent Verification
```

Two architectural views describe the same system:

**Engineering model**

```text
Specification → NEIR → Validation → Policy → AI Context → Generation
```

**AI Engineering control plane**

```text
Agent Intent → Policy Decision → Authorized Execution
            → Observation → Evidence → Independent Verification
```

The first describes how engineering knowledge moves through NAEOS. The second describes how agent actions are controlled and made auditable.

## Core concepts

| Concept | Role |
|---|---|
| **Specification** | Declares system intent and engineering requirements |
| **NEIR** | Canonical engineering representation derived from specifications |
| **Policy** | Determines which proposed actions are permitted |
| **Runtime** | Executes only within the authorized boundary |
| **Evidence** | Records observable results and integrity-relevant metadata |
| **Verification** | Independently checks claims about outputs or side effects |
| **Handoffs** | Carries explicit contracts between agents, tools, and execution boundaries |
| **AI Compiler** | Translates engineering context into agent-specific instructions |
| **Extensions** | Adds profiles, plugins, adapters, and integrations without changing the core model |

## See it run

The fastest way to understand NAEOS is the CLI control-plane demo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NAEOS-foundation/naeos.git
cd naeos

go build -o naeos ./cmd/naeos
./examples/demo-cli/run-demo.sh
```

The demo exercises the specification-first pipeline and produces traceable run metadata.

**Golden Path:** [docs/GOLDEN-PATH.md](docs/GOLDEN-PATH.md) defines the reproducible five-minute flow, acceptance criteria, and evidence map used for technical evaluation and regression testing.

**Reference Demo & Evidence Story:** [docs/REFERENCE-DEMO.md](docs/REFERENCE-DEMO.md) turns the same run into an independent reviewer checklist, traceability narrative, and partner-pilot evidence format.

**External Validation:** [docs/EXTERNAL-VALIDATION.md](docs/EXTERNAL-VALIDATION.md) provides a reproducible third-party runbook and evaluation record.
**Engineering Note #001:** [docs/ENGINEERING-NOTE-001-EXTERNAL-VALIDATION.md](docs/ENGINEERING-NOTE-001-EXTERNAL-VALIDATION.md) explains the engineering rationale and evidence boundary for independent external validation.

**External Validator Program:** [docs/EXTERNAL-VALIDATOR-BRIEF.md](docs/EXTERNAL-VALIDATOR-BRIEF.md) is the public entry point for Cohort #001; see [Program](docs/EXTERNAL-VALIDATOR-PROGRAM.md) and [Missions](docs/EXTERNAL-VALIDATION-MISSIONS.md) for the program protocol.

For the Todo API demonstration:

```bash
go build -o naeos ./cmd/naeos
./examples/todo-api/run-demo.sh
```

See [START-HERE.md](START-HERE.md) for the supported onboarding path.

## A concrete run

The `naeos run` path exposes structured engineering-run metadata, including identifiers such as:

```text
run_id
specification_hash
neir_hash
validation_state
policy_evaluation
generated_context
artifacts
evidence
```

The goal is not merely to generate code. The goal is to preserve enough engineering context and evidence to understand **what was intended, what was authorized, what happened, and what can be verified**.

## AI coding agents

NAEOS is designed to remain vendor-neutral at the engineering layer.

NAEOS targets Go **1.26.6 or later** and can produce agent-specific instruction/context artifacts for tools such as:

- GitHub Copilot
- Claude Code
- OpenAI Codex
- Cursor
- Gemini CLI
- OpenCode
- Windsurf

The engineering model remains upstream of the individual agent. Changing agents should not require rebuilding the project's engineering rules from scratch.

## Evidence and verification

NAEOS includes engineering experiments and implementation paths around:

- policy boundaries and authorization
- durable audit/evidence records
- tamper detection
- handoff contracts
- independent verification
- artifact signing and verification
- SBOM generation
- security and vulnerability checks
- benchmark and fuzz gates

These experiments are evidence of specific mechanisms and behaviors. They should not be interpreted as blanket proof of every production property.

See [experiments/](experiments/) for the current experiment suite, including the **Evidence V5.6** milestone.

## Trust model

NAEOS is built around explicit boundaries:

1. **Intent is not authorization.**
2. **Policy decisions are distinct from runtime execution.**
3. **Observations are distinct from claims.**
4. **Evidence should outlive an agent's conversational memory.**
5. **Verification should not depend solely on the component making the claim.**
6. **Untrusted handoff input must not silently become downstream authority.**
7. **Controllable boundaries must be revalidated before consequential external actions.**
8. **Version and contract mismatches should fail closed where required by the governing specification.**

These are engineering principles, not guarantees that every integration is automatically safe.

## Architecture authority

NAEOS uses a normative documentation hierarchy:

```text
Constitution
    ↓
Reference Architecture
    ↓
Master Technical Specification
    ↓
Engineering Specifications / ADRs
    ↓
Implementation
    ↓
Experiments
```

Public guides such as README, START-HERE, and GETTING-STARTED explain and navigate the system; they do not override normative specifications.

Start with [DOCUMENTATION-AUTHORITY.md](DOCUMENTATION-AUTHORITY.md), then review:

- [NAEOS Reference Architecture](Reference%20Architecture/NAEOS-NRA-001.md)
- [NAEOS Master Technical Specification](NAEOS-MTS-001.md)
- [NAEOS Specification](specification/NAEOS-SPEC-001.md)
- [NEIR](docs/NES-023-NEIR.md)
- [CLI Reference](docs/NES-028-CLI-Reference.md)

## Slack + GitHub community

NAEOS uses Slack for real-time engineering coordination and GitHub as the durable engineering source of truth.

- [NAEOS Slack Community](https://naeos.slack.com) — real-time engineering discussion
- [GitHub repository](https://github.com/NAEOS-foundation/naeos) — source code, issues, pull requests, and evidence

For workspace administrators, install the official [GitHub integration for Slack](https://slack.com/apps/A01BP7R4KNY-github), then subscribe the relevant channels to repository activity. The integration supports GitHub notifications, issue and pull-request collaboration, rich link previews, and GitHub actions from Slack. See [GitHub's Slack integration documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/integrations/how-tos/slack).

Recommended operating model:

```text
Slack coordinates → GitHub records → CI verifies → Evidence closes the loop
```

For public community acquisition, use the workspace's Slack shared-invite URL rather than the workspace home URL. Keep that invite URL configurable in the website deployment so it can be rotated without changing repository code.

## Community and partnerships

- [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/NAEOS-foundation/naeos/discussions) — technical discussion and ideas
- [Discord](https://discord.gg/naeos) — community discussion
- [NAEOS Partner Program](PARTNER-PROGRAM.md) — technology, infrastructure, AI, academic, community, pilot, and strategic collaboration

## Social identity and distribution

[Social Identity Source of Truth](docs/SOCIAL-IDENTITY.md) defines the canonical public positioning, channel roles, profile copy, visual rules, and verification status for NAEOS social distribution.
